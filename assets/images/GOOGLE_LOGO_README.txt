Google Logo Image Required
==========================

The file 'google_logo.png' is referenced in the app but not included.

To add the Google logo:
1. Download the official Google logo from: https://developers.google.com/identity/branding-guidelines
2. Save it as 'google_logo.png' in this directory (assets/images/)
3. Recommended size: 24x24 pixels or larger (will be scaled down)

Alternatively, the app will use a fallback "G" icon if the image is not found.
